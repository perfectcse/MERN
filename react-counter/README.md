Day-9
Building Full CRUD operations:

Create
Read
Update
Delete

Day-10
Understanding API architecture and backend flow.
Day-11
Handling frontend API errors and responses.
Day-12
Improving backend project structure.
Day-13
Implemented JWT Authentication:

User login
Token generation
Protected routes

Day-14
Added Role-Based Authorization (RBAC):

Admin role
Protected admin actions
Secure API access

Day-15
Implemented JWT Expiry Handling:

Token expiration check
Auto logout when token expires
Session management on frontend

Day-16
Added Request Validation Middleware:

Validate API request data
Prevent invalid data from entering the database
Proper 400 Bad Request responses

Day-17
Implemented Global Error Handling Middleware:

Centralized error responses
next(error) pattern in Express
Cleaner and more maintainable backend architecture

Day-18

Pagination in API

GET /api/posts?page=1&limit=5

page → current page
limit → items per page

skip = (page-1) * limit

MongoDB:
.skip()
.limit()

Day-19

Search + Filtering API

GET /api/posts?search=react

MongoDB search:
$regex
$options: "i"

Combine with pagination
?page=1&limit=5

Day-20

Sorting API

req.query.sort

MongoDB:
.sort()

latest → createdAt: -1
oldest → createdAt: 1
title → title: 1

Combine:
search + pagination + sorting

Day-21
Advanced Filtering

MongoDB:
$or

Search multiple fields:
title + body

Combine:
search + sort + pagination

Day-22

Date Filtering

MongoDB:
$gte
$lte

Filter:
createdAt

Combine:
search + sort + pagination + date

Day-23:
- Learned API query params (search, sort)
- Connected frontend filters with backend
- useEffect dependency concept
- MongoDB regex search
- Sorting using .sort()
- Built real-time dynamic UI

Day-24:
- Implemented frontend pagination
- Managed page state in React
- Connected page with API query params
- Added Previous and Next buttons
- Learned pagination flow frontend → backend → database

Day-25:
- Created Layout component
- Created Dashboard page
- Created StatsCard reusable component
- Added Dashboard route
- Learned reusable component architecture
- Learned layout structure in React

Day-26:
- Created /api/auth/me API
- Created Profile page
- Added Profile route
- Added Profile link in Navbar
- Protected Profile route
- Fetch current logged-in user
- Authorization header
- JWT user identification
Day-27
What I Learned Today
How comment system works
How to connect Post and Comment collections
How to protect routes using JWT middleware
How to fetch data using useEffect
How to refresh data after API action
Component communication using props
Basic UI styling

Day 28 of MERN Stack 🚀
Today I started working on the Reply to Comments (Nested Comments) feature in my MERN Blog project.
Learning:
• Nested comments structure
• Parent & child comments
• Improving Single Post page
• Better UI for comments section
Project is slowly becoming a full MERN Blog / Social App.

day-29 Work:
- Implemented Like Comment feature
- Implemented Edit Comment feature
- Added edited flag in comments
- Display likes count in UI
- Display comment timestamp
- Only comment owner can edit/delete
- Used PUT request for update operations
- Updated comment routes and controller
- Added edit UI in React
- Used conditional rendering for edit input

Day-30
MongoDB countDocuments()
MongoDB aggregate()
JWT Authorization Header
Protected Routes
Dashboard Stats API
Axios Headers
React Dashboard UI
Grid Layout CSS
Role Based Authorization
Comments Count per Post

Full backend + frontend integration

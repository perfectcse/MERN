Day-18

Pagination in API

GET /api/posts?page=1&limit=5

page → current page
limit → items per page

skip = (page-1) * limit

MongoDB:
.skip()
.limit()

Day-19

Search + Filtering API

MongoDB search:
$regex
$options: "i"

Combine with pagination
?page=1&limit=5

Day-20

Sorting API

req.query.sort

MongoDB:
.sort()

latest → createdAt: -1
oldest → createdAt: 1
title → title: 1

Combine:
search + pagination + sorting

Day-21
Advanced Filtering

MongoDB:
$or

Search multiple fields:
title + body

Combine:
search + sort + pagination

Day-22

Date Filtering

MongoDB:
$gte
$lte

Filter:
createdAt

Combine:
search + sort + pagination + date

- Added Profile link in Navbar
- Protected Profile route
- Fetch current logged-in user
- Authorization header
- JWT user identification
Day-27
What I Learned Today

How to fetch data using useEffect
How to refresh data after API action
Component communication using props
Basic UI styling

Day 28 of MERN Stack 🚀
Today I started working on the Reply to Comments (Nested Comments) feature in my MERN Blog project.
Learning:
• Nested comments structure
• Parent & child comments
• Improving Single Post page
• Better UI for comments section
Project is slowly becoming a full MERN Blog / Social App.

day-29 Work:
- Implemented Like Comment feature
- Implemented Edit Comment feature
- Added edited flag in comments
- Display likes count in UI
- Display comment timestamp
- Only comment owner can edit/delete
- Used PUT request for update operations
- Updated comment routes and controller
- Added edit UI in React
- Used conditional rendering for edit input

Day-30
MongoDB countDocuments()
MongoDB aggregate()
JWT Authorization Header
Protected Routes
Dashboard Stats API
Axios Headers
React Dashboard UI
Grid Layout CSS
Role Based Authorization
Comments Count per Post

​​📒 Day 31 – Short Notes
